/**

 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.

 *

 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means

 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.

 * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.

 *

 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide

 * https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How

 * to implement supply mechanisms].

 *

 * The default value of {decimals} is 18. To change this, you should override

 * this function so it returns a different value.

 *

 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert

 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless

 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20

 * applications.

 *

 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.

 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just

 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit

 * these events, as it isns overridden.

     *

     * NOTE: This information is only used for _display_ purposes: it in

     * no way affects any of the arithmetic of the contract, including

     * {IERC20-balanceOf} and {IERC20-transfer}.
